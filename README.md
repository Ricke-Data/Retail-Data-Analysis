# Retail Data Analysis

This project focuses on managing and analyzing retail data from five stores across three cities. It covers the entire data lifecycle, including:

- **Database Creation**: Designed and implemented the database structure.
- **Data Ingestion**: Input data from sales receipts similar to POS terminals.
- **ETL Processes**: Extracted, transformed, and loaded data using Oracle Data Integrator (ODI).
- **Data Warehousing**: Developed and maintained a data warehouse for efficient data storage and management.
- **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations and reports using Power BI.

## Features

- Comprehensive data management for retail sales.
- Efficient ETL processes ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
- Organized and easily accessible data storage through data warehousing.
- Clear and actionable insights using Power BI visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- SQL and PL/SQL

## Purpose

This project demonstrates my knowledge in data management, ETL processes, data warehousing, and data visualization. It was designed to showcase my skills, knowledge, and understanding of these areas.

## How to Use

## Review the SQL scripts:

- Check the SQL scripts in the `sql/` directory to see how the database was created and populated.

## Open the Power BI file:

- Open the Power BI file in the `powerbi/` directory to explore the visualizations and reports.

## View ODI process examples:

- Review the images of ODI processes in the `images/odi` directory to understand the ETL processes.

## View database examples:

- Review the images of the database in the `images/maxi` directory to see the structure and data.
